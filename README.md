# CASE STUDY

This is a case study for Zolo a co-living space management company has a lot of interns/ fresh graduates & young professionals coming to stay in PGs/ hostels. I perform analysis for a unique situation where it need to evaluate the best applicants for a particular hostel when there is high demand in the month of June/ July where there are more applicants for the hostel than its capacity. There was no data given by zolo to perform EDA or Modeling.

Key Problem
-----------
To find out the best applicants for a particular hostel from a given pool in the month of June/July when there is a high demand.

I have taken the public Data for Analysis:
